# 1. unary minus 
# a=10
# b= -a   #-10
# print(b)

# 2. Relational Operators 
# concepts: it used to compare two values, they either return true or false 

# ==

# x=-5
# y=4
# print(x==y)  -- equal
# print(x!=y)  #-- not equal 
# print(x<=y)

# 3. logical operator 

# Concepts: Logical operators are used to combine conditional statements 

# and: returns true if both conditions or statement is true 
# statement A     Statement B       Result
# False           False             False
# False           True              False
# True            False             False
# True            True              True


a= 10
b= 10
c= 5

# print(a>c and b>c) --- and operator

# or operator -- any one condition must be true
# print(a==c or b==c)


# balance = 15000
# withdraw_amount = 50000

# if withdraw_amount <= balance:
#     print("withdrawal approved")
#     balance = balance - withdraw_amount
# else:
#     print("Insufficient Funds")
# print(f"Remaining balance: {balance}")


# question 1:
#  user will give a temperature 
# you have to determine if the temperature is in safe range or not (safe range is from 15 to 30)
# if yes: temperature is in safe range and if it is not then say it is dangerous
# a=10
# if a>5:
#     print("hello")
