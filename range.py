#  a range is a sequence of numbers, typically used for looping a specific number of times in loops.
# It generates numbers from a starting point up to but not including endpoint


# it is immutable sequence of numbers, it is typically used in loops
# r = range(start, stop, step) by default step =1

# r = range(1,10,2)
# result = list(r)

# print(result)
# 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9
# 1     3     5     7     9

# print(list(r))

new_range=range(5)
# print(list(new_range))

for i in new_range:
    print(i)
